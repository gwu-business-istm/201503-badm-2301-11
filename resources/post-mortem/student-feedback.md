## Student Feedback

### Pros

#### Professor Knowledge

Some students characterized the professor as knowledgable.

> The professor is very knowledgeable, and so it was a great opportunity to learn from his expertise.

> I think professor Rossetti is very knowledgeable about the subject ...

> I feel like the Professor is very knowledgeable about the course matter ...


#### Professor Interactions

Some students expressed satisfaction with their "one-on-one" interactions with the professor.

> ... once I met with (the Professor) in office hours, I was able to understand the assignment... Overall, I think he is ... always willing to help us in any way he could.

> ... professor is very good working with students one on one








### Cons

#### Connection between Lectures and Homework

Some students expressed a desire for greater link between lecture material and assignments. Some struggled to translate the information into their own independent efforts.

> The assignments should reflect what is done during class.

> Sometimes I felt like the lectures didn't prepare us enough for the assignment ...

> Lectures need to contain ... material to build up to projects and the final assignment.

#### Pace and Scheduling

Some students expressed desire for more repetition of concepts.

> ... spend more tha(n) one class day on each subject.

> I'd suggest spending more time going over concepts.  I felt like a lot of students were not able to grasp concepts once they fell behind because the class would move so quickly.  

Some students expressed a desire to split the long one-day class into two different classes, citing information overload.

> ... this class should meet twice a week for half the time because one long class is just too much complicated information at once

> The format of a two-and-a-half hour class is really hard ... this class should be split up into two days.

#### Intro Course Considerations

Some students felt that because it was an introductory class that it should have been easier, or grading standards should have been lowered.

> Potential improvements include simplifying information communicated to students so that it is at an introductory level, as well as lower grading standards since it is an introductory class.

> ... make the assignments more relevant to an introductory class ...

Some students expressed a desire for simpler subject matter explanations.

> ... it was difficult to understand ... without previous knowledge on the subject matter.

> This class was too difficult for the experience we had coming into it (none).

> (the Professor) didn't dumb anything down for us and we really needed some more explanations.

> (the Professor) skipp(ed) over details that he assumed the class would find intuitive.

> Understand that not everyone has a basic understanding of how to use some of the software we use in class

> Assume that students have no idea about the course material when teaching it.
