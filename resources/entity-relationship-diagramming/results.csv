38,0.9,1,,1,,96.7%,improve by avoiding line jumps and clear space between different cardinality markers
28,1,0.9,1,0.8,1,94.0%,check cardinalities;
39,0.95,0.9,1,0.9,,93.8%,double-check assumption of relationship between Listener and Listener Account on the basis of name attributes; check stated assumptions; add missing cardinalities
2,0.95,0.8,1,1,,93.8%,check your assumptions - some are problematic; check entity names
16,0.9,0.9,,1,,93.3%,"no need to link Listener Account with Play - one direct relationship is between Listener and Listener Account, and the other is between Listener and Play"
14,1,1,,0.8,,93.3%,check Thumb/Play cardinality
15,1,0.9,,0.8,,90.0%,check cardinalities; no need to diagram indirect relationships like Listener Account / Play and Song / Thumb
24,0.9,0.9,1,0.8,,90.0%,restrict to a single printed page to improve clarity; check cardinalities
20,1,0.85,,0.8,,88.3%,check relationships: there is no direct relationship between Listener and Skip;
23,0.8,0.9,1,0.8,,87.5%,the relationship between Song and Listener is not a direct relationship - instead each is related directly with Play; check cardinalities
25,0.9,0.8,,0.8,1,87.5%,check entity names and cardinalities
18,1,0.8,,0.8,,86.7%,check cardinalities
7,1,0.8,,0.8,,86.7%,good attention to detail regarding cc_holder_name; check cardinalities
27,1,0.8,,0.8,,86.7%,no need to relate Listener Account with Play because that direct relationship is between Listener and Play; check cardinalities
33,0.8,1,,0.8,,86.7%,check cardinalities; reduce/remove line jumps to improve clarity
35,1,0.8,,0.8,,86.7%,check relationships: need relationship between Play and Listener; the relationship between Listener Account and Skip is indirect

32,0.6,1,,1,,86.7%,connect all entities in the same diagram; no need to diagram indirect relationships like Listener Account / Skip;
21,0.9,0.9,,0.8,,86.7%,check cardinalities
17,0.85,0.9,,0.8,,85.0%,check cardinalities; increase clarity with which relationships are identified; only represent direct relationships

12,0.9,0.8,,0.8,,83.3%,good use of colors to provide additional clarity for line-skips - at the same time recognize some people are color-blind;

1,0.8,0.8,,0.8,,80.0%,check entity names; no need to draw relationships between indirect entities like between Skip and Thumb - they each have a direct relationship with Play and you can link them together on that basis; check cardinalities
