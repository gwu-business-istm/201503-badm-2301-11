# Group Project

## Description

Students will work together in instructor-assigned teams of two, three, or four
 to plan and design
 a **relational database-backed information system**
 which fulfills the component assignment requirements.

### Component Assignments

The [Midterm Pitch](assignments/group-project/midterm-pitch.md) evaluates student ability to
 identify and analyze business problems and processes,
 identify an information system solution,
 and describe system objectives and information requirements.
 Systems with the demonstrated ability or possible potential to provide real-world impact are desirable.

The [Final Deliverable](assignments/group-project/final-deliverable.md) evaluates student ability to
 describe in detail
   system objectives and design. The final deliverable should include information about system components like hardware, software, networks, and database.

The [Final Presentation](assignments/group-project/final-presentation.md) evaluates student ability to
 communicate and demonstrate system design.

## Submission Instructions

Refer to the submission instructions for each component assignment.

Each group should elect a representative who will be responsible for communicating progress and submitting assignments on behalf of all group members.

## Evaluation Methodology

Refer to the evaluation methodologies for each component assignment.

Each member of the group will receive the same grade for each group project assignment submission.

At the end of the semester, a group member evaluation form will give each student an opportunity to identify the relative contributions of each other group member. The result of these evaluations may influence individual grades on group project assignments.
