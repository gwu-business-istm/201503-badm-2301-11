## Evaluation Methodology

Students, instructors, and possible guest judges will evaluate each presentation in terms of content and delivery.

Evaluations will be averaged to produce a single group grade for each presentation. This provides a baseline for the final grade.

Group grades will be compared, sorted, and ranked. Group rank may contribute to the final grade, as necessary.
