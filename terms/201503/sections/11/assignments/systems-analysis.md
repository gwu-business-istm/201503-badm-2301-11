# Systems Analysis

Identify **three** real-world information systems by name.
 The more familiar you are with each system the better.
 Two should be high-tech (web or mobile-based) information systems.
 One should be a non-tech or low-tech information system.

> Avoid using generic system classifications like TPS, MIS, DSS, health record management system, etc.

> Avoid using business names in favor of specific applications or systems employed by the business.

Explicitly identify the information inputs and outputs of each system.

Identify the purpose of each system. What business value or advantage does it bring to its creator? What value does it bring to its users?

Identify and analyze a few business processes employed by each system. Which processes work well? Which ones need improvement, and how might they be improved?

Describe the user interface of each system. How do humans interact with the system?

If possible, describe the data storage mechanisms for each system. Does the system discard its data or does it retain it?

> Technology specificity is not required.

If possible and applicable, describe the hardware and software that power each system.

> Technology specificity is not required.

Finally, in summary, contrast at a high-level the three different systems in terms of their inputs, outputs, processes, user interfaces, datastores, hardware, and software. How are the systems alike? How do they differ?
