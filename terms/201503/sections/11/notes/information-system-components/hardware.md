# Hardware

**Hardware** describes any physical device or equipment used to
 "... accept, process, (store, or) display data and information"
 within the context of a computer system ([Rainer 1, TG-1](/README.md/#accompanying-textbook)).

Examples of hardware include at least these classes of computing devices:

 + personal computers
 + web servers
 + mobile phones
 + tablets
 + monitors
 + keyboards
 + mice and track-pads
 + printers
 + styluses
 + sensors
 + scanners
 + microphones
 + cameras
 + hard drives
 + memory cards

**Moore's Law** describes/predicts
 the doubling of microprocessor growth/capacity/ability every two years.

Practically, in addition to describing the increase of processing capacity over time,
this trend also indicates a decrease in processing costs over time.
