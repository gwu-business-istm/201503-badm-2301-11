# Introduction to Information Systems

## Definition

An Information System processes information inputs into outputs for a specific purpose.
 Information Systems need **information** inputs and outputs. Processing of inputs and outputs does not necessarily qualify a system as an IS. Presence of information does not necessarily constitute an IS.

A system may process different kinds of information, according into the following hierarchy:

information term | meaning | example
--- | --- | ---
**Data** | A description of something, not necessarily organized or synthesized to provide meaning. | numbers, words, dates, images, files
**Information** | Data that has been organized or interpreted to provide meaning and value. | a chart of datapoints over time depicting an upward trend in sales
**Knowledge** | Data and/or Information that has been organized, processed and interpreted to convey understanding, experience, accumulated learning, expertise, etc. | an informed decision to raise marketing expenditure levels

Information Systems may or may not leverage technology.
 A computer-based Information System uses
 a related group of computer components working together
 to process information inputs into information outputs
 for a specific purpose.

### Components

Components of a computer-based IS generally include:

 + [Datastores](information-system-components/datastore.md)
 + [Hardware](information-system-components/hardware.md)
 + [Networks](information-system-components/networks-and-protocols.md)
 + [Software](information-system-components/software.md)
 + People, and Interfaces

Presence of one or more IS components does not necessarily constitute an IS.

### Capabilities

Information Systems can perform numeric computations,
 facilitate communication and collaboration,
 automate business processes, and more.

### Classifications

Information Systems are classified
 based on
  system purpose,
  functionality,
  scope,
  audience,
  and type of information processed.

system type | general functions | system sub-classes | specific example(s)
--- | --- | --- | ---
Operational | Sends and receives data. | Transaction Processing, Office Support, online ordering systems, payroll processing | An ATM, the GW Bulletin web service (uses URL params),
Managerial | Processes and synthesizes data into information. | Business Intelligence, Decision Support, library management systems | A proprietary Google Elections info system responsible for producing real-time election result maps
Executive | Processes and synthesizes information into knowledge; emulates **human** decision-making and judgement processes. | Decision Support, Expert, Machine Learning, self-driving cars | GW Housing Selection System, IBM Watson, Tesla Model S

## Advantages

Businesses use Information Systems to create and maintain a **competitive advantage**
 in terms of:

 + cost
 + quality
 + speed
 + accuracy
 + scale

## Planning and Management

Build vs Buy

Development Methodologies:

 + Waterfall/Traditional
 + Agile

### Traditional Systems Development Lifecycle (SDLC):

 1. Requirements Gathering and Investigation
 * Analysis
 * Planning
 * Design
 * Programming and Testing
 * Implementation
 * Operation and Maintenance
