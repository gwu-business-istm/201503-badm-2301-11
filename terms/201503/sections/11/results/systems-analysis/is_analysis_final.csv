14,50,100,good addition of specific systems instead of general categories of system; good discussion of info inputs and outputs
31,87,100,good identification of a lower tech system than previous submission
29,0,100,"good system identification, info input and output identification, and system comparison"
2,87,100,good revision of naming specific systems
38,87,93,"good addition of digital camera metadata discussion; good terminology revision to ""network-based emailing systems""; could specify a better INFORMATION output of the food ordering system as perhaps a ""receipt"" than the food itself,"
24,87,93,"good addition of an exec summary; self-checkout INFORMATION outputs are probably better described as a ""receipt"" than the items themselves; good thoroughness of analysis;"
8,75,93,"good terminology revisions; need to identify an INFORMATION output of the coffee ordering system, which is probably more likely to be a receipt or written information than the drink itself"
1,87,93,could benefit from a specific example of a GPS. could benefit from more explicit identification of the INFORMATION outputs of a personal shopper than the clothes themselves.
15,87,93,"could still benefit from identification of a specific implementation of the ""Dewey Decimal System""; would the INFORMATION output of DDS be the ""location of the book"" instead of the physical book itself?"
35,87,93,"good terminology revisions; could still be more careful about identifying the INFORMATION output of the deli ordering system - it's probably more appropriate to identify a ""receipt"" or ""written price"" than the actual food."
9,87,93,"good re-identification of a low-tech system; could still use a more careful identification than ""Microsoft Word"""
22,87,93,"could still be more careful and precise with language in terms of the definition of an info system, as well as what the INFORMATION outputs of Uber are..."
30,75,93,looking for non-tech system info output identification
7,87,90,"good explicit input and output description revisions for two of the systems; could specify a better INFORMATION output of the food delivery system as perhaps a ""receipt"" than the food itself, and similar feedback for the second system's info outputs as well"
11,87,90,"could be more explicit with language that identifies information outputs - i.e. describe a ""report"" or an ""alert notification"" instead of describing what a ""user may do"" to interact with the output; also could better describe the INFORMATION output of the deli order system as a ""receipt"" or ""written price"" instead of the food itself"
10,87,87,N/A
28,75,87,"be careful about using general language like ""all systems""; could benefit from identification of an INFORMATION output of the gallery ordering system as a ""receipt"" instead of the food itself; same feedback about the Uber ""ride"" not being an INFORMATION output"
26,75,87,could be more careful in identifying system names and outputs - the car ride and the sandwich are not necessarily INFORMATION outputs
39,50,87,"good identification of specific systems instead of general categories of system; could benefit from identifying a lower-tech system than one which uses pedometers, which you describe/define using the word ""technology"""

19,50,87,"good identification of specific systems; could be more explicit in identifying the info inputs and outputs, although in some cases you do mention the kinds of information that the system produces as a result of processing the inputs and in other cases you describe general system functions which require some inference to identify inputs and outputs"
20,75,87,could use more explicit descriptions of amazon.com system's information outputs
25,75,87,"be careful about making general claims like ""all businesses do something""; could still be more careful and precise with language, especially when identifying info systems and inputs and outputs - ""spreadsheets"" are a general category of software, which may be components of an IS"

4,0,75,"need to identify specific systems, not general categories of system for your tech systems; could be more careful than when you describe the INFORMATION output of the starbucks ordering system as the drink itself"
18,0,70,"good terminology revisions; could still be more careful about identifying the INFORMATION output of the deli ordering system - its probably more appropriate to identify a ""receipt"" or ""written price"" than the actual food."
6,50,66,"please identify specific systems instead of general categories of system; ""printers, copiers, and fax machines"" are hardware, not systems themselves; ""networks"" are networks, not necessarily systems; could use explicit identification of info inputs and outputs for all systems"
