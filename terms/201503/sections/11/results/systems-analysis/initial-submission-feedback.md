--- | ---
100	|	good job; could provide more explicit identification of inputs and outputs; solid argument for the blood pressure cuff
100	|	careful and concise language; explicit identification of info inputs and outputs; good comparison
100	|	good identification of specific systems; good identification of info inputs and outputs; examples of human info outputs could be stronger, although the decision-making component of "covering ears" is perhaps sufficient; sufficient discussion of value to users and creators; sufficient discussion of components and storage strategies; overall, the breadth of topics, clarity of understanding, and logical framework for discussion overcomes a somewhat weak justification for humans as info systems
100	|	good explicit identification of info inputs and outputs; updated submission corrects the specificity requirements lacking in the first submission's identification of a general POS; good identification of strengths and weaknesses, human interactions, and storage; could benefit from a more succinct comparison, although comparisons do exist throughout the paper;
100	|	good discussion of system purposes; good identification of systems; good identification of info inputs and outputs (although a drink is an output, a more appropriate description of the info output might be "the markings on the coffee cup"; good discussion of value to users and creators; good discussion of processes; good comparison;
100	|	good definition of info system; good identification of specific info systems, inputs, and outputs (although "Jetties" is a business name and perhaps a more appropriate system name would be "Jetties sandwich ordering system"; good discussion of processes; good discussion of purposes; good discussion of data storage; good discussion of value to users and creators; good comparison
87	|	good job; could be more careful and precise with language, especially when describing the definition of an IS; could be more explicit in identifying info inputs and outputs; could use a more specific and familiar example in place of the "rolodex"; good job describing processes in detail; could provide a more thorough comparison of systems
87	|	good job; could be more careful and precise with language, especially when describing the definition of an IS; could use a more specific and familiar example in place of the "card catalogue"; could present a stronger case for the "digital camera" by mentioning the process by which it incorporates metadata like lat/long and datetime to each photo; the info output for "email" is probably better described as the message itself, rather than the "exchange"; good comparison
87	|	good detailed description of processes for each system; focus could be shifted from analysis of how each system works on the inside to what observable functions it performs, in terms of inputs and outputs; good analysis of value brought to creators and users; could be more careful and precise in communicating the definition of an info system; good identification of the time clock as a low-tech system; comparison could use additional clarity
87	|	good identification of specific systems; could be more explicit in identifying info inputs and outputs; thorough description of system processes; good comparison
87	|	good job; could be more careful with your definition of an info system; could use a more specific example of a library system and online help center - which ones?; good description of advantages to users and creators; good discussion of processes; could benefit from more explicit info input and output definitions;
87	|	could use proof-reading; good identification of info systems, inputs and outputs; good discussion of purposes and user interactions; justification for "phone book" could be stronger - is the book itself a more fitting example of an info output?
87	|	good job; could benefit from identification of a specific implementation of the "Dewey Decimal System" ; good discussion of processes; good discussion of value to users; could use more explicit identification of DDS info inputs and outputs
87	|	could benefit from a specific example of "online air ticket booking systems", but this identification is sufficient; could be more careful in identifying a sub-system within "League of Legends" instead of the game itself; good identification of info inputs and outputs; please use taller line heights to make reading easier; good discussion of purpose and value to users and creators;
87	|	good identification of info inputs and outputs; good description of system purposes; could use a stronger justification of "MS Office" as an IS - is it more representative of software, which is a component of an IS?
87	|	good job; good identification of info inputs and outputs; good description of processes, datastores, and technologies; could benefit from more precise terminology when identifying the "GW Deli" - maybe a more appropriate identification is "food ordering system at GW Deli"; good comparison; with a few terminology changes this can become a 100
87	|	good job; could use more careful identification of "kiosks" as an IS - are these more appropriately classified as hardware? how about "food ordering system at Deli X"? also if this system functions as you describe, it might not be the best example to use as a low-tech system; could use more careful identification of info inputs and outputs; good discussion of system purpose and processes; good discussion of
87	|	good job; could be more careful and precise with language, especially when describing the definition of an IS; good identification of info inputs and outputs; good discussion of processes; good discussion of value to users and creators; could use a more careful identification of "Word" as an IS - how about "spell checker system" et.al.?, although the justification in terms of info outputs is sufficient- nice job; identification of a lower-tech system than Word, along with minor language changes can bring this up to a 100; good comparison
87	|	good job; good identification of info systems, inputs, and outputs; good discussion of value to users; could use more careful language when describing "gravity score" as a process because it is perhaps a better example of an info output; good discussion of technologies and hardware; could benefit from a specific implementation of the "Dewey Decimal System"; good comparison
87	|	good job; could benefit from a lower tech example than a mobile app like the "desktop calendar on the Surface Pro 3"; good identification of info inputs and outputs; good discussion of value to users; good discussion of processes; this is a strong submission that can be a 100 with the identification of a lower tech system; good discussion of system purposes; good comparison
87	|	good job; could be more careful and precise with language in terms of the definition of an info system - software is a component of an IS, not necessarily an entire system, however the focus on info inputs and outputs is sufficient; could use more precision in identification of systems, as "Megabus" and "Uber" are companies - for all three, what are the systems employed by the individual or business? (e.g. "Megabus' online bus ticket ordering system"; good identification of info inputs and outputs; good discussion of processes; good discussion of interfaces and value to users; this is one of the better justifications for "human" as an IS that I have read; with more careful language this can be a 100
87	|	good job; could benefit from a specific example of a "GPS" and a specific "MS Access" application; good identification of info inputs and outputs; good discussion of value to users and interfaces; good discussion of components like software; great justification for the low-tech "Door-to-Door" survey; good comparison; with minor language changes this becomes a 100
75	|	could be more careful in naming the gallery market itself as a system because perhaps a more clear identification would be "the gallery marketplace food ordering system"; good identification of system strengths and weaknesses; good identification of info inputs and outputs, except for the starbucks app example, which could use further clarification; be careful about making factual claims without providing citations; comparison could benefit by focusing on the defining characteristics of an information system, and by clarifying language like "a lot of human interface"
75	|	could be more careful in naming "monitors" as a system because this describes a piece of hardware, which is a component of an IS but not an IS itself. also the monitors are not datastores themselves. perhaps try referring to the "food ordering system"; great detail and thoroughness of each system; good explicit identification of inputs, outputs, purpose, etc; insufficient info output example for the email contact system; the current grade of 75% is not necessarily indicative of the high quality of your paper. with minor terminology changes, this submission is likely to receive a100%
75	|	could be more careful in definition of an info system, and in their identification - a more appropriate system identification would be "coffee ordering system" than "Dunkin Donuts" which is the business that employs the system; good identification of info inputs and outputs; with minor terminology changes this submission can be a 100
75	|	be careful about making general claims without providing citations; could be more careful and precise with language, specifically in identifying a system employed by "Amazon" and "The Bagel Place", not just the companies themselves; could use more explicit identification of info inputs and outputs; good discussion of user interactions and processes;
75	|	could be more careful and precise with language, especially when describing the definition of an IS and identifying specific systems -  "Amazon" is a business; good discussion of system purposes; could be more explicit in identifying info inputs and outputs; good discussion of processes; could use proof-reading;
75	|	could be more careful and precise with language, especially when identifying info systems and inputs and outputs - "spreadsheets" are a general category of software, which may be components of an IS, and "cab ride" isn't an information output, and what are the thermometer's info inputs?; good discussion of value to users; good discussion of processes;
75	|	could use a more careful identification of "Google Drive" as an IS - is it a better example of a software component of an IS?; good discussion of system purpose and value to users; "ride reservation system" is a good way to describe Uber's IS; could be more careful and explicit with identification of info inputs and outputs - "service in which the drivers bring people from one place to another" isn't necessarily an information output; good discussion of processes; could use a better example of a low-tech info system- what are the info outputs of a "combination lock"?
50	|	please identify specific systems instead of general categories of system; you may re-submit anytime and inform me of your submission and I will provide feedback;
50	|	please identify specific systems instead of general categories of system; you may re-submit anytime and inform me of your submission and I will provide feedback; be careful about choosing the specific systems. data like "Written messages and letters" are part of an IS, but the system in its entirety might more accurately be identified as a "message delivery system" like gmail or the usps, etc.
