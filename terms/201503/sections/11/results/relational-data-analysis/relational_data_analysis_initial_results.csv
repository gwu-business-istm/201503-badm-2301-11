28,1,0.8,1,93.3%,cool dataset; good exec summary; please paste SQL text or increase screenshot zoom level; improve repeatability by using WHERE clause for filtering instead of eyeball-filtering
15,1,0.8,1,93.3%,"good demonstration of selecting distinct - try using it in conjunction with a group by statement to maximize confidence in the result; can use equality operator in where clause ... WHERE score = 100; if answering a questions of quantity, perform SQL count() in favor of eyeball counting; check your from clause in query 3;"
33,1,0.8,1,93.3%,good use of LIKE to parse that violation code attribute; can you replicate in SQL your manual math (like counting and finding percentages) to make your findings more repeatable?

34,0.8,0.6,0.5,63.3%,good analytical instincts to turn information into knowledge; demonstrate use of an outer join; strengthen connection between SQL and summary of findings - can you write a query to produce the min and max score change for each business? and count those matching some criteria?; good repeatability otherwise; expand factual findings to include more quantifiable analysis
31,0.7,0.4,0.7,60.0%,"organize factual findings into an exec summary which is separate from the SQL; check your counting and grouping - if you're going to count ids, group by another attribute else you will get a count of one id per each id; check query syntax - does each execute without error?; check your join from inspections to violations - do you need a different join condition?;"
