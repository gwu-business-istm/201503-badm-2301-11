# Software (Version Control and Hosting) Lab Exercise

Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, and send your username to an instructor in a chat message.

Visit this [example open source student website](https://github.com/gwu-business/student-site), and click a button in the top right corner to "Fork" the repository. This will copy the repository to your account. Rename the repository as applicable.

Download the [GitHub Desktop application](https://desktop.github.com/) onto your personal computer (windows or mac).

Configure and sync the Github Desktop client so your hosted GitHub repositories are copied to your local computer. Note the download location.

Change the README or some other trivial part of the forked student site repository,
 then save your changes, and "commit" them.

Perform another sync (with the "master" branch) and your local changes should be reflected on GitHub.

Push your changes to a new branch called "gh-pages" and visit your website online at: `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME`.github.io/`YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME`, (e.g. http://gwu-business.github.io/student-site/).
