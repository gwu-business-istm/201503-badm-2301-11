# Personal Website Lab Assignment

Refer to Internet Technology [notes](/notes/internet-technologies.md) and [resources](/resources/internet-technologies/client-side/).

## Description

Make a website for any productive personal or business purpose.
 If you get stuck, try making a site which details your personal, professional, and academic activities and accomplishments.

Your website should contain at least three different .html files,
 as well as any scripts, images, and icons needed for proper function and form.

The site should maintain consistent style and navigation across pages.

You may use a front-end web development framework
 like [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#download-cdn)
 to reduce development efforts and conform to familiar web standards.

## Suggested Elements

The site should contain at least one of each of the following HTML elements:

 + `<h1>` and/or other [headings](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_headings.asp) as necessary
 + `<div>`
 + `<p>`
 + `<a>`
 + `<ul>` OR `<ol>`, in conjunction with `<li>`
 + `<img>`
 + `<script>` OR link to an external .js script
 + `<style>` OR link to an external .css stylesheet
 + at least one [HTML5 semantic element](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, etc.
 + rich media embeds (optional)

HTML elements may need to be assigned `id`, `class`, and other attribute values as appropriate to produce proper form and function.
